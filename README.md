PINEAPPLE
---------

([English](./README.md) | [中文](./README-zh-CN.md))


# Description

Go implementation of Pineapple, a simple programming language demo. Includes a hand-written recursive descent parser and a simple interpreter.

The language is not even Turing-complete, however, it is meant to introduce compiler theory to beginners and shed light on how a programming language is built.


# Usage

```sh
cd examples/pineapple/
go build
./pineapple hello-world.pineapple
# You got "pen pineapple apple pen."
```
